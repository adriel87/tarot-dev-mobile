### order to installation 📋

1. install node in your LTS version
2. install dependencies
5. run the scripts


### Steps installations 🔧

2. install dependencies

if you never work whit node take it easy, node work whit a package manage like maven in Java or nuggets in .NET

for the beggining open a terminal and execute the next command

```bash
npm i

3. launch Scripts

***run in local***
in Ionic projects usually we install `Ionic/cli` just a command line interface to launch script for ionic

open a terminal again and type the next 

```bash
ionic serve
```
and then look how your project wake up in localhost, by default at the end of the script you see the url where the project is running press whit ctrl + click in terminal if you are in visual studio code or copy the link and paste in your favorite browser

***Build aplication***

the build is used if you want deploy your app in a server or if you need build a android or ios project

```bash
ionic build
```

***android***

if you want to test the app in android

1. install android estudio
2. maybe you need to configure a enviroment variables to indicate where are android studio
3. launch the next script whit ionic cli before `Build aplication`
```bash
ionic cap add android
ionic cap open android
```

in package json you have a script to avoid the step 3 open your terminal and type

```bash
npm run android
```
> execute in order build , add android, open android
